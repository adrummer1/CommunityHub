# CommunityHub

Welcome to CommunityHub, a simple application where community organizers can post neigborhood projects needing volunteer support. 

## Application Use

When organizers open the application, they can sign up or log in to post community projects to a board. When community residents visit the application, they can see a list of upcoming projeects posted by organizers. If a resident would like to volunteer to work on a project, they can sign up or log in, visit the project page, and add themselves to the project. They can also remove themselves from projects they previously joined.

## Technology

The CommunityHub app is a MERN-stack single-page application with a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL Api, and Express.js and Node.js server with a react front end. We implement user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.
